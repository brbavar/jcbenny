      <p>
        Mainstream philosophy of religion has fallen into disrepute, even among
        its own practitioners. The discipline sorely needs reconstruction and
        reinvigorationâ€”of the sort Willard Van Orman Quine famously spearheaded
        in metaphysics, a field which was in Quine's day lambasted by an
        influential cadre of philosophers and scientists known as the Vienna

      <Quote
        text={
          '[P]hilosophy . . . as an effort to get clearer on things, is not to be distinguished in essential points of purpose and method from good and bad science.'
        }
      />
      <p></p>
    </body>
